Learning path order

Classification 
    - MNSIT
    - Cifar
    - imagenet
    - resNet 
Regression  
    - stock price guessing 
    - 
Move away from Dense nets 
    - Cant go too deep 
    - dont scale well with depth
    - have vanishing gradients 
    - have too many parameters
    RNN - recurrent neural networks
    ConvNets
Auto



List / Vector -> Dense data works okay, not too deep

grid data, discritized -> ConvNets

point cloud neural networks -> Graph NN or Transformers

Transformers are good at relationships
    - NLP
